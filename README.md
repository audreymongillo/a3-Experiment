# Description
For our experiment we decided to implement our own version of the Cleveland and McGill study. We tested 4 different 
types of charts to determine which had the least error when predicting the percentage of size. We tested bar charts, 
horizontal bar charts, packed circles, and stacked bar charts. We tested our experiment on 11 different participants, 
obtaining 220 total trials for each type of chart. Based on the average log2 error from the trails, the charts best 
to worst are as follows: 1. Horizontal bar chart 2. Bar chart 3. Packed circles 4. Stacked bar chart

# Technical Achievements
For our technical achievement we did an extra chart type. We added a packed circles chart, which is something we had not
yet had much experience implementing. By adding this extra chart, we were able to see how more types of charts compared 
to each other. We were also able to see how well users can spot the difference in area instead of just height. Using 
bar graphs tested mostly the users ability to determine how different heights compared to each other, but by using 
circles, we were able to test area as well. Another technical achievement we added was connecting out next button to the
enter key on the keyboard. Instead of having to click next after each trial, users are able to just click the enter 
button to move on to the next one. 

# Design Achievements
For our design achievement we added a background tab to the start page of our experiment. Users are able to navigate to 
the background tab to learn more about our experiment, where the experiment came from, and what we plan on doing with 
the data. This screen allows the user to have more information about what they are participating in. At the end of our 
experiment we also added a results page to show the user a graph of their own results and a breakdown of the average 
log2 error they got for each type of graph. This allows the user to get instant feedback on how they did and gives them 
an initial idea as to what the results of the experiment may be.
